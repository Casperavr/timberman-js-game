# Timberman js game

## Introduction
Are you tired of trees getting in the way of building the city of the future (18-lane highway with parking lots and mcdonalds)? Do you also bottle up emotions? Do you also release that pent up anger into video games like an adult, instead of dealing with them? Then look no further than this game!

## How to play
The game is simple, chop the tree and avoid the branches of death using the arrow keys. To make sure you really grasp the urgency of, and the need for deforestation, you have also been confined to a countdown timer. A timer, that, when it reaches zero, kills you.

## Further development
There is always room for improvement. For example, animations for the chopped logs would be cool, background images for the floating messages and adding general styling rules. Also responsive design is a big opportunity for improvement: screen size and browser type.

## Used technologies
The webpage was constructed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
