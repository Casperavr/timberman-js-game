# Timberman js game

## Introduction
Are you also really tired of trees getting in the way of building the city of the future (18-lane highway with parking lots and mcdonalds)? Do you also vent your bottled up emotions into video games like an adult instead of dealing with them? Then look no further than this game!

## How to play
The game is simple, chop the tree and avoid the branches of death. To make sure you really grasp the urgency of, and the need for deforestation, you have also been confined to a countdown timer. A timer, that, when it reaches zero, kills you.

## Further development
There is always room for improvement. According to my vision, animations for the chopped logs would be cool, background images for the floating messages and some more general styling rules.

## Used technologies
The webpages was constructed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
